Aecount for Windows Phone
=========================

This is the Windows Phone port of my iOS app called ["Aecount"](https://github.com/superjohan/aecount). It is a very simple gesture-based counter app. You can set the title and goal.

The app is still very much work-in-progress. I only started writing in order to learn both C# and the Windows Phone frameworks better. Feedback on code quality is very welcome, and encouraged.

Implemented so far:
- Increment. (tap on the count, or swipe to the left)
- Decrement. (swipe to the right)
- Increment/decrement animations.
- Reset the count to 0 by pinching.
- All values are saved to IsolatedStorageSettings.

Still missing:
- There should be an animation after pinching is completed.
- Visual representation of the goal.

If you want to contact me, I'm @suprjohan on Twitter, and @jkh on App.net.
